# chess-club
Just an exercise to keep updated. A simple app to manage a chess club. 


## First MVP

- Just having a list of members with some chess properties like ELO etc.
- A simple database like mysql to store the data
- A simple web interface to manage: create, edit, remove, list.
- Maybe latter some REST APIs but not in this moment
